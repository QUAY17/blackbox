# blackbox

In this project, I had a black box of seven functions. I had to find their runtime complexity by testing each function with a variety of input sizes.
After gathering the necessary data from each function in the blackbox, I plotted the points using gnuplot and then determined the complexity for each mystery algorithm.

I created a program to test and time each algorithm, and simultaneously take the average of three tests. I iterated 5 times each algorithm. I visualized the data with gnplot and some computations, including the asymptotic error of the fit. 

There were some considerations that needed to be made regarding size of input number for testing.

A makefile is included. Follow the arument directions when running ./main.
